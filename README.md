# WaterResortReservationSystem

this is a simple website designed for a water resort hotel to do all the reservations and bookings.

to start the website follow these steps:

1. extract files in a folder
2. create an virtual enviroment(use python 3.8)
3. if you are using a different version you will face some problems while installing dependencies so reach me asap for that.
3. check python version using "python --version"
4. command for virtual enviroment is "python -m venv nameofenv"
5. activate venv using "nameofenv\scripts\activate"
6. install dependencies using "pip install -r requirements.txt" (if you recieve any error in the dependencies let me know)
7. if they all install succesfully use command "python manage.py migrate". (only necessary if any changes are made).
8. then use "python manage.py runserver".
9. local link "https://127.0.0.1:8000"

if you are downloading the project the photos for rooms might not load since they are connected with the database and database
encoding saves the data and file location based on each computer uniquely. Sorry for Trouble!
